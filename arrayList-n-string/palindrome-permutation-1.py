"""
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is 
a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the 
same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

brute force,  NOTICE: if this code is written because I thought the program
is required to also output the palindrome permutation set. Therefore, I 
generated all possible solution and filtered them all here. I might be hard to
check string longer than 15 chars. However, this program includes the way to 
check whether a string is a palindrome or not. 

simply check number of chars make sure all number of chars (such as 'a'..) is divisible by 2,
except for one.
Case 1: all char appears N times, and N%2 == 0
Case 2: all char appears N times, and N%2 ==0, except for one char that is allowed to appears odd times. 

Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.) Hints:#106,#121,#134,#136
