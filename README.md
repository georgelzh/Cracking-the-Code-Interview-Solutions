# Interview-Preparation
I have been learning and practicing for code interviews. 
I use the amazing book called "Cracking the Code Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. 
I have my own solutions and the solutions from the book posted here.  It's all written in python. 

Thanks to the author for writing this amazing book!
